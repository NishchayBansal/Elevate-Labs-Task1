"Scan your Local Network for Open Ports"

1. First, we installed NMAP from the official website. 
2. Then we found our local IP range by command: ipconfig. 
3. We ran the command: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 to perform TCP SYN scan.
4. Then we noted down some of the IP addresses and the open ports found.
5. Captured packets through Wireshark and analysed them.
6. Searched the Common services running on these ports like TCP, TLSv1.2, ICMP, UDP etc.
7. We found out the potential security risks like data theft, sensitive information leakage, data manipulation, financial or reputational losses, Malware distribution, cyberattacks, etc.
8. Lastly, saved this result in a word file.
PFA the word file.
